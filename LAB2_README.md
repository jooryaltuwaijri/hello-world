# ARTI 308 – Lab 2: Heart Disease Prediction

## Dataset
- **Name:** Heart Disease Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle (UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains medical attributes of patients such as age, sex, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate. It also includes a target variable indicating whether a patient has heart disease.

## Machine Learning Problem
- **Problem Type:** Classification (Supervised Learning)
- **Target Variable:** `target`
  - 1 → Presence of heart disease
  - 0 → No heart disease

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes. The model aims to learn patterns from historical patient data to support early diagnosis.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Kaggle Notebook

## Project Contents
- Jupyter Notebook for loading and inspecting the dataset
- Methodology diagram illustrating the machine learning workflow
